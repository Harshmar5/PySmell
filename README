PySmell is an alternative omnicompletion library for Python.

It has two parts: The Python library that does the analyzing, and the Vim script that calls into the library. 

It works by analyzing your codebase once, saving information in a TAGS file, and using that to provide context-aware completions. 

There is more documentation in the README and in pysmell.vim
